## Hi, I'm Noureldin Abdelmonem

I'm a **Site Reliability Engineer** passionate about observability, system internals, and cloud infrastructure. I work across multiple cloud platforms and contribute to the Kubernetes ecosystem, particularly focusing on code quality and control plane observability.

## What I Do

My work revolves around building reliable, scalable systems and contributing to open-source projects. I'm currently focused on:

- **Kubernetes & Cloud Native**: Active contributor to Kubernetes and related projects like kube-state-metrics and metrics-server
- **Observability**: Building and implementing observability tools and practices for distributed systems
- **Linux Internals**: Deep diving into system internals and performance optimization
- **Open Source**: Contributing to various open-source projects, particularly in the Kubernetes ecosystem

## Technical Focus

- **Primary Language**: Go
- **Specializations**: Kubernetes, SRE practices, observability, cloud infrastructure
- **Interests**: System internals, performance engineering, distributed systems

## Open Source Contributions

I'm an active member of the Kubernetes organization and have earned recognition as a "Pull Shark" for my contributions to the open-source community. You can check out my contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/nmn3m).

## Projects

Some of the key projects I work with:

- **Kubernetes**: Contributing to the production-grade container orchestration system
- **kube-state-metrics**: Generating cluster-level metrics from Kubernetes API
- **metrics-server**: Container resource metrics for Kubernetes autoscaling
- **playground**: CLI tool for managing local Kubernetes clusters using K3s and Multipass
